! This file contains commands to be read in for a Pythia8 run. 
! Lines not beginning with a letter or digit are comments.
! Names are case-insensitive  -  but spellings-sensitive!
! The changes here are illustrative, not always physics-motivated.

! 1) Settings that will be used in a main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 10000        ! number of events to generate
Main:timesToShow = 50              ! show how far along run is this many times
Main:timesAllowErrors = 10         ! abort run after this many flawed events

! 2) Beam parameter settings. Values below agree with default ones.
Beams:idA = 2212                   ! first beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:idB = 2212                   ! second beam, p = 2212, pbar = -2212
Beams:eCM = 7000.                  ! CM energy of collision

! 3) Pick processes and kinematics cuts.
Top:gg2ttbar = on                  ! g g -> t tbar
Top:qqbar2ttbar = on               ! q qbar -> t tbar
PhaseSpace:mHatMin = 200.          ! ??
PhaseSpace:pTHatMin = 200.         ! minimum pT of tops?
! --> Turn off all W decays
24:onMode = 0
! --> Turn back on W- decaus to leptons only
24:onNegIfAny = 11 13 15
! --> Turn back on W+ decays to quarks only
24:onPosIfAny = 1 2 3 4 5


! 4) Other
! Tune:pp = 10 ! use Tune 4C
! --> Decay radius 1cm? (no!!)
! ParticleDecays:limitTau0 = On
! ParticleDecays:tau0Max = 10.0
Random:setSeed = on
Random:seed = 1234
